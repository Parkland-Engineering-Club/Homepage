      <h3>Welcome to the Parkland Engineering Club Website</h3>
      <p>The Engineering Club at Parkland College provides students with opportunities to delve into topics in engineering and physics through hands-on projects, challenging questions, talks from industry professionals, and more. We meet every Wednesday at 2pm in room M126. It doesn't matter how much experience you have, what major you are in, or how much you hate physics, the Engineering Club is a great place to learn new things, meet some great people, and ocasionally grab a slice of pizza. </p>

      <p>This measley attempt at a website was created by Joseph on a whim on the second night of what is quickly turning into 3 all nighters in a row back to back.<span style="font-size:.25em;"> At this point, I don't even know if any that makes sense but in other stories people have told me about their dogs and really want them to stop because they didn't actually bring dog but they of course brought along their vivid description of what sounds like the cutest, friendliest, most beautiful dog besisdes mine (gotta saw that incase my dog learns how to read in the future.) You never really can know who your friends are. I bet my dog can betray me for food faster than yours. Man, that dog would push me off a cliff if it meant he <em>might</em> get an early dinner.      Aight now I'm hugry. Adios</span></p>
